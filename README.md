# Ex.No.4b--MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION
## AIM
To develop a Heart Disease Prediction model using machine learning classification algorithms and compare the performance of different models using suitable evaluation metrics.
##  OBJECTIVES
•	To understand machine learning classification. 

•	To analyze a heart disease dataset. 

•	To identify the input features and target variable. 

•	To preprocess the dataset. 

•	To divide the dataset into training and testing data. 

•	To train different classification models. 

•	To predict whether a patient has heart disease. 

•	To evaluate and compare the models. 
## INTRODUCTION
•	Machine Learning enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions. 

•	Classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict categories or classes.

•	In this experiment, classification algorithms are used to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. 

•	The output generally contains two classes: 
o	0 – No Heart Disease 
o	1 – Heart Disease 
## DATASET
The dataset contains medical information about patients.
Typical attributes include:
Attribute	Description
Age	Age of the patient
Sex	Gender of the patient
Chest Pain	Type of chest pain
Resting BP	Resting blood pressure
Cholesterol	Cholesterol level
Fasting Blood Sugar	Blood sugar condition
Resting ECG	Resting electrocardiogram result
Maximum Heart Rate	Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise Angina	Exercise-induced angina
Oldpeak	ST depression value
Target	Presence or absence of heart disease
## TARGET VARIABLE
•	Target is the dependent variable. 
•	It indicates whether the patient has heart disease. 
•	Usually: 
0 → No Heart Disease
1 → Heart Disease
6. DATA PREPROCESSING
### Steps
1.	Load the dataset. 
2.	Display the first few records. 
3.	Check dataset shape. 
4.	Check data types. 
5.	Check missing values. 
6.	Handle missing values if present. 
7.	Separate features and target. 
8.	Encode categorical variables if required. 
9.	Split the dataset into training and testing data. 
10.	Apply feature scaling where required. 
### Code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv("heart_disease.csv")

print(df.head())
print(df.shape)
print(df.info())
print(df.isnull().sum())
7. SEPARATE INPUT AND OUTPUT
X = df.drop("target", axis=1)
y = df["target"]
•	X → Patient characteristics. 
•	y → Heart disease prediction. 
###  TRAIN-TEST SPLIT
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42,
    stratify=y
)
•	80% → Training data 
•	20% → Testing data 
## FEATURE SCALING
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()

X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
## MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
The following models can be compared:
1.	Logistic Regression 
2.	K-Nearest Neighbors 
3.	Decision Tree 
4.	Random Forest 
5.	Support Vector Machine 
6.	Gradient Boosting 
## LOGISTIC REGRESSION
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

lr.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

y_pred_lr = lr.predict(X_test_scaled)
##  K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

y_pred_knn = knn.predict(X_test_scaled)
## DECISION TREE
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(
    random_state=42
)

dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred_dt = dt.predict(X_test)
## RANDOM FOREST
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    random_state=42
)

rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred_rf = rf.predict(X_test)
## SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
from sklearn.svm import SVC

svm = SVC(kernel="rbf")

svm.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

y_pred_svm = svm.predict(X_test_scaled)
## GRADIENT BOOSTING
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(
    random_state=42
)

gb.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred_gb = gb.predict(X_test)
## MODEL EVALUATION
The models can be evaluated using:
•	Accuracy 
•	Precision 
•	Recall 
•	F1-score 
•	Confusion Matrix 
## Code
from sklearn.metrics import (
    accuracy_score,
    precision_score,
    recall_score,
    f1_score
)

models = {
    "Logistic Regression": y_pred_lr,
    "KNN": y_pred_knn,
    "Decision Tree": y_pred_dt,
    "Random Forest": y_pred_rf,
    "SVM": y_pred_svm,
    "Gradient Boosting": y_pred_gb
}

for name, prediction in models.items():

    print(name)
    print("Accuracy :", accuracy_score(y_test, prediction))
    print("Precision:", precision_score(y_test, prediction))
    print("Recall   :", recall_score(y_test, prediction))
    print("F1 Score :", f1_score(y_test, prediction))
    print()
## MODEL COMPARISON
<img width="591" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb058f3-4231-475d-92d1-2e64233ac6a0" />

Comparison
•	Higher Accuracy → Better overall classification. 

•	Higher Precision → Fewer false-positive predictions. 

•	Higher Recall → Better identification of patients with heart disease. 

•	Higher F1-score → Better balance between precision and recall. 

For a medical prediction task, recall is particularly important because missing a patient who actually has the condition can be more concerning than generating an extra positive prediction.
## CONFUSION MATRIX
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_rf)

sns.heatmap(
    cm,
    annot=True,
    fmt="d",
    cmap="Blues"
)

plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix - Random Forest")

plt.show()

## CONCLUSION
Thus, machine learning classification models were successfully applied for heart disease prediction, and their performance was compared using standard classification evaluation metrics.
